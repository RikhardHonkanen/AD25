# Fizz Buzz

Using TDD, develop a function that for a given natural number greater zero returns:

    “Fizz” if the number is divisible by 3

    “Buzz” if the number is divisible by 5

    “FizzBuzz” if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5

    The number if it is not divisible by both 3 and 5

To compile the module, unity and build and run the test, use make and a makefile.
